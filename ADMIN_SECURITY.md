# Admin-Only System Security Configuration

## Overview
The website has been configured as an admin-only content management system where:
- Only administrators can register and login
- Regular users can only book appointments and submit contact forms
- All content management is restricted to authenticated admin users

## Changes Made

### 1. Registration Disabled
- **File**: `routes/web.php`
- **Change**: `Auth::routes(['register' => false]);`
- **Result**: Public registration is completely disabled

### 2. Admin-Only Middleware
- **Created**: `app/Http/Middleware/AdminOnly.php`
- **Registered**: `bootstrap/app.php` with alias `'admin'`
- **Purpose**: Ensures only authenticated users can access admin areas

### 3. Admin Routes Protection
- **File**: `routes/admin.php`
- **Change**: Updated middleware from `['auth']` to `['admin']`
- **Protected Routes**: All `/admin/*` routes require authentication

### 4. Login Redirects Updated
- **Login Controller**: Redirects to `/admin` instead of `/home`
- **Home Route**: `/home` redirects to admin dashboard
- **Login Page**: Updated with admin-only notice

### 5. UI/UX Updates
- **Admin Login**: Clear notice that this is admin-only access
- **Frontend Navigation**: No login/register links (only booking/contact)
- **Admin Navigation**: Full admin dropdown in authenticated layout

## User Experience

### For Regular Visitors:
- Can browse the website (home, about, services, contact)
- Can book appointments via `/fr/booking` or `/en/booking`
- Can send messages via `/fr/contact` or `/en/contact`
- Cannot register or login (no links provided)

### For Administrators:
- Login at `/login` with existing admin credentials
- Access admin dashboard at `/admin`
- Manage services, appointments, and settings
- Full CRUD operations on all content

## Security Features
- All admin functionality requires authentication
- Registration is completely disabled
- Clear separation between public and admin areas
- Proper middleware protection on sensitive routes

## Default Admin Account
- **Email**: admin@coaching.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Created**: During database seeding

## Recommendations
1. Change the default admin password after first login
2. Consider adding email notifications for new appointments/contacts
3. Regular backups of the database
4. Monitor admin access logs if needed in production
